# Studium Game Engine

Studium is a modern engine for building 2D and Pixel Art games in C++.

## About the Project

Studium is a game engine for 2D games, based on everything I've learned so far about game development, while developing other engines.
This engine is being designed to be used by me for a long period of time, be it professionally or for quick sketches.
While this may seem ambitions, I do believe that, if one could take the time needed studying good programming patterns and being extra
careful while building its own game engine, it is possible to build something robust and easy to hack into, if new features are needed.
Though this engine really is supposed to be monolithic, the coding structure and documentation should provide easier means to debug
issues and add new features.

Most of the design, documentation and coding principles applied here remount back to my brief and ongoing experience with the Rust
language, so even though I opted to write this engine in C++, these principles help make the code easy to read by programmers of any
level.

Studium tries to use a modern C++ while still remaining as close as possible to C itself, without breaking coding consistency. That
means trying to avoid an overuse of object-oriented programming and STL, though it is not a forbidden resource to use, since the
game programming industry favors C++ anyway. Despite that, this engine is primarily developed for Linux systems, so that's where it
should be running first. However, other operational systems are not excluded from the equation; favoring cross-platform libraries is
a must.

The exceeding engine features are also supposed to be kept optional on compilation, though it is best if the engine is used at its
full potential.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The following libraries and software are required to build `studium`:

- OpenGL 3.3 support or higher
- GLFW >= 3.2
- Epoxy >= 1.4.3
- GLM >= 0.9.8

The following libraries are optional, but recommended, to build `studium`:

- ChickenScheme >= 4.12

Consult your trusted repositories for the packages for developing software with these libraries.

### Building

Building Studium is pretty much straightforward.

Given that you already have the dependencies installed, you can build it using CMake:

```bash
$ cd path/to/repository
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

This will create a `libstudium.a` file, which is our library, and the `engine_test` binary, which is the general test project.

#### Using Emacs

This project has an out-of-the-box support for [`cmake-ide`](https://github.com/atilaneves/cmake-ide) on Emacs. Simply open any
code file on any subdirectory, and the `.dir-locals.el` will set the `cmake-ide` variables for you (this process may result on
Emacs specifically asking you if you really want to run unsafe code, since the bindings rely on the usage of the `eval` form).
Once it is done, you can run them build commands directly from Emacs:

```
M-x cmake-ide-run-cmake
M-x cmake-ide-compile
```

This will create a `*compilation*` buffer from where you can look at the actual compilation process.

### Installing

After building the software using the instructions from previous section, just use the following command to install the software.

```bash
$ sudo make install
```

On a Linux distribution, this will install the header files on `/usr/local/include/studium`, and the actual library will be
installed to `/usr/local/lib`.

## Contributing

If you wish to help with the development of this software, please check the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for coding and commit
guidelines.

You can also refer to the [ongoing projects page](https://github.com/luksamuk/studium/projects) of this repository, so you can more
easily look out for what to contribute with.

### Documentation

To properly document any code you might write to contribute with this project, please check the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)
file also.

### Testing

This project still lacks a proper way to perform unit tests. Once it is added, this section will be updated.
